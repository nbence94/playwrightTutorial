#### Playwright Practice
This is a practice project created for learning Playwright with JavaScript. Its purpose is to explore the basic functionalities of Playwright and understand how it works. The project is in an early stage and is intended solely for learning purposes, not for production use.

The framework is built based on a simple structure:

The 'utils' folder stores all helper scripts.
The 'pages' folder contains objects for different pages of the website, utilizing the utilities.
The 'tests' folder stores the test cases, which are executed by run.bat.
The 'config' folder holds the configuration files.
This structure ensures clarity and organization while practicing Playwright automation.
